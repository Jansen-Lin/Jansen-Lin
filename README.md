# 👋 __Hi! Welcome to Jansen Lin's GitHub Repository!__

## 😀 About Me

- I'm an aspiring data analyst/data scientist/ML Engineer/AI Engineer.
- I hope to harness the power of data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, to bring positive impact to the world.
- I'm really excited about the developments in these fields and I believe that dabbling into them can greatly empower me to find solutions to the myraids of problems that we are facing today.

      <td>I created the IOU-based Layout Matching Algorithm as part of a 7 month computer vision project co-sponsored by AI Singapore (AISG) &amp; Continental (our client). The concept of IOU (Intersection Over Union), forms the foundation of this custom algorithm. I was able to achieve layout matching accuracy of over 98% on our Client's dataset, which was comparable, if not better than that of the state-of-the-art ML algorithms (self-supervised learning algorithms). Due to the Research Collaboration Agreement (RCA) signed between AISG &amp; Continental, I am not able to reproduce the work that was done and publish on GitHub.</td>
