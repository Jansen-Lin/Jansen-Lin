# 👋 __Hi! Welcome to Jansen Lin's GitHub Repository!__

## 😀 About Me

- I'm an aspiring data analyst/data scientist/ML Engineer/AI Engineer.
- I hope to harness the power of data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, to bring positive impact to the world.
- I'm really excited about the developments in these fields and I believe that dabbling into them can greatly empower me to find solutions to the myraids of problems that we are facing today.

## 🧠 Jansen's Original Projects

|Project Name|Description|Status|
|---------|----------|------|
|[IOU-based Layout Matching Algorithm](https://github.com/Jansen-Lin/layout-matching-algo)| I created the IOU-based Layout Matching Algorithm as part of a 7 month computer vision project co-sponsored by AI Singapore (AISG) & Continental (our client). The concept of IOU (Intersection Over Union), forms the foundation of this custom algorithm. I was able to achieve layout matching accuracy of over 98% on our Client's dataset, which was comparable, if not better than that of the state-of-the-art ML algorithms (self-supervised learning algorithms). Due to the Research Collaboration Agreement (RCA) signed between AISG & Continental, I am not able to reproduce the work that was done and publish on GitHub. <br>| Private |

## 🤝 Collaborative Projects

|Project Name|Description|Status|
|---------|----------|------|
|[Litter Dectection with YOLOv5 & TACO Dataset](https://github.com/Jansen-Lin/aiap-team1-litter-detection)| This is a mini-project done during the final week of the deepskilling phase as part of the [AI apprenticeship programme (AIAP)](https://aisingapore.org/innovation/aiap/), with the aim to improve AI Singapore's workflow and welfare. The object detection model is trained using the open-source YOLOv5 object detection model from Ultralytics, on a subset of the [TACO](http://tacodataset.org/) dataset, which is an open image dataset of waste in the wild. | Public |


## 🔎 Exploration & Learning

|Repo Name|Description|Status|
|---------|-----------|------|
|[test_bed_repo](https://github.com/Jansen-Lin/test_bed_repo)|Repo for quick and dirty test bedding of new ideas, new codes, anything useful and interesting, or anything i learnt off youtube, articles, ChatGPT, etc. Mainly notebooks will be used as it is great for visualisation and learning, but there is really no limits here. :) | Public |
|[streamlit-datacamp](https://github.com/Jansen-Lin/streamlit-datacamp)|To explore streamlit via [DataCamp's guide](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/streamlit). | Public |

## 📑 Reference Materials

|Repo Name|Description|Status|
|---------|-----------|------|
|[ai-practitioner-handbook](https://github.com/Jansen-Lin/ai-practitioner-handbook/tree/main)|AI Practitioner Handbook <br>https://aisingapore.github.io/ai-practitioner-handbook/|-|
|[emoji-cheat-sheet](https://github.com/ikatyang/emoji-cheat-sheet/blob/master/README.md#face-affection)|Cheat sheet for emoji, which is automatically generated from GitHub Emoji API and Unicode Full Emoji List.|-|
