# üëã __Hi! Welcome to Jansen Lin's GitHub Repository!__

## üòÄ About Me

- I'm an aspiring data analyst/data scientist/ML Engineer/AI Engineer
- I hope to harness the power of data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, to bring positive impact to the world, especially in driving sustainability.
- I'm really excited about the developments in these fields and I believe that dabbling into them can greatly empower me to find solutions to the myraids of problems that we are facing today.

## üß† Jansen's Original Projects

|Project Name|Description|Status|
|---------|----------|------|
|[IOU-based Layout Matching Algorithm](https://github.com/Jansen-Lin/layout-matching-algo)| I created the IOU-based Layout Matching Algorithm as part of a 7 month computer vision project co-sponsored by AI Singapore & Continental (our client). The concept of IOU (Intersection Over Union), forms the foundation of this algorithm. I was able to achieve accuracy of over 98% on our Client's dataset, which was comparable, if not better than that of the state-of-the-art ML algorithms (self-supervised learning algorithms). Due to the Research Collaboration Agreement (RCA), I am not able to reproduce the work that was done. <br>| Private |
